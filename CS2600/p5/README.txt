Tee.C

This is my implementation of the standard tee command in unix. 

To use this command my program is extremely user friendly. 

1. Please compile the tee.c program with the gcc compiler
	ex: gcc tee.c
2. Enter the executable command ./a.out followed by filenames or none. 

Common test may be: 

	./a.out test.txt test2.txt -a

	./a.out 

	./a.out test.txt test2.txt test3.txt


If the files specified in the arguments do not exist in the folder this program is running in, the program will create new files with specified titles. 

Enjoy! 
	please email ajsanna@cpp.edu with any questions/concerns.
