Welcome to my first repository! 

This serves as a portfolio to upload my projects to share with the world. 
Please excuse the messy code / inproper comment styles. 
All of this code was written for the purpose of being graded, rather than being uploaded for the world to see. 
I have the projects organized by course with labels describing what each course entails. 

For a more comprehensive summary of my skills please see personal projects REPO. 
This serves as my experience and knowledge gained through my undergrad enrollment at Cal Poly Pomona. 

With any questions/concerns, kindly contact ajsanna@yahoo.com
